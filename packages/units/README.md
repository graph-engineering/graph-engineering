### TODO

- much better documentation
- better system for handling default configs (so that editor can see)
- adding new properties be explained (understand relative to base unit)
- docs explain what the source type should be
- save fp until export then export both functional and conventional styles?
- use objectmap

- new types (low-hanging fruit):
  - angle

* new types (harder):
  - weight (assuming earth) or mass?
  - duration (from time)
  - date
  - location -> tries to go out and get stuff async
  - price / or specific types like dollar?

TODO:
