### TODO

- much better documentation

##### new types (harder):

- location -> tries to go out and get stuff async
- price / or specific types like dollar?

##### alternative design possibilities:

- fix `moment` library drift (1000 years -> milliseconds -> years)
- export each package
- investigate making graphql queries completely flexible

- scalar distance

consider
