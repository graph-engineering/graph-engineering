### TODO

- much better documentation
- better system for handling default configs (so that editor can see)
- adding new properties be explained (understand relative to base unit)
- docs explain what the source type should be
- new Types:
  - weight (assuming earth) or mass?
  - fuel efficiency (inverted measurements, can't use simple tables)
  - temperature (not linear, can't use simple tables)
