### TODO

- much better documentation
- better system for handling default configs (so that editor can see)
- adding new properties be explained (understand relative to base unit)
- docs explain what the source type should be

- new types (low-hanging fruit):
  - force?
  - frequency?

* new types (harder):
  - weight (assuming earth) or mass?
  - fuel efficiency (inverted measurements, can't use simple tables)
  - temperature (not linear, can't use simple tables)
  - duration (from time)
  - date
  - location -> tries to go out and get stuff async

consider

1. selection types for dictating
